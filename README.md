# Shoesland

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
This flutter project is a shoe app. Here, the user can view the shoes, like them, see the best sellers from the best sellers page, and then add that item to Carta, decide how many to buy, and then proceed to the checkout section.

Of course, this is just one design, and there are many variations on this project.


## Deficiencies in the program

Like I said it's just a design. The program has many bugs and often lacks clean code.

## I will do in the future

I will connect the program to the real-time database and store the data there, and the user will be able to register and view the products conveniently.

The Search function is the future.
The edit function will be added to the profile page.
Although I made the filter just as a design, in the future it will change and the shoes will actually be selected according to the filters.
